This program takes data from a user's Chess.com account and gives them insights based on that data. 
This program also allows users to easily transcribe their chess games, and will save the game to a .txt file. 
Additionally, data from the game (the opening used, who won/lost, who played as black/white, etc.) 
will be stored to another .txt file which contains that player's "profile" 
based on all other games they have transcribed using this program if they have used it before.
